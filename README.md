# Library Management System
The aim of this project is to develop a computerized sysetm which will help to maintain all the library tasks.
The project helps both the Library staff and the students to check for availability of books,
which book was issued when and statistics about which books were more frequently issued.
This will give the management an idea about all the books that need to be stacked up.
This software integrates the java Swing GUI library with the SQL database and uses concepts of 
object oriented programming. The software is gives an added advantage to students as now they can
check the book availability without roaming in the library trying to search for a book.
It keep a track of the date issued and dat of return of a book.
